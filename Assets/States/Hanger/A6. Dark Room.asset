  storyText: "Right, well, that took far longer than anticipated but the lock is
    off and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud.
    \r\n\r\nYou're in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the top of the combustion
    boilers. You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, \"shut off the valves...\", THUNK
    THUNK, \"...get out in time?\", THUNK THUNK, \"...massive pressure\", THUNK THUNK
    \"...for glory\"... THUNK THUNK...\r\n\r\nWhat next, Adventurer?\r\n\r\n1. Get
    closer to the people speaking.\r\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
